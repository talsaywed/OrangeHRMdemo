## 📘 Project Overview

This project involves testing the **OrangeHRM Demo website**, a publicly accessible HR management system used for HR operations such as employee management, user administration, and personal information management.

The goal of this project is to:

- Validate core HR workflows  
- Identify functional defects  
- Develop Cypress automation for stable flows  
- Build full QA documentation (Test Plan, Test Cases, Bug Reports, RTM)  

Both **manual testing** and **automation testing** are included to simulate a real QA environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧪 Manual Testing Documents

All manual testing artifacts are stored inside:

➡️ `/Documents/OrangeHRM Demo Project.xlsx`

### This file includes:
- **Test Cases** (positive & negative scenarios)  
- **Bug Reports** (detailed, reproducible defects)  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**  
  - Requirement → Test Case → Status → Bug Relationship  

These deliverables demonstrate structured test design and complete coverage.

-----------------------------------------------

## 📄 Test Plan

The Test Plan defines:

- Project scope  
- Testing objectives  
- In-scope & out-of-scope modules  
- Test approach (manual + automation)  
- Test schedule  
- Entry/exit criteria  
- Risks & assumptions  
- Test environment  

➡️ Located at: `/Documents/TestPlan_OrangeHRMdemo.pdf`

----------------------------------------

## 🤖 Cypress Automation

Automation scripts are located in the **OrangeHRM** folder.

### Automated Scenarios Include:
- Login with valid credentials  
- Login validation with invalid input  
- Add new user  
- Search for a user  
- Delete user  
- Partial regression flows  

These tests follow Cypress best practices and use a clean, modular structure.

----------------------------------------------

## ▶️ Running the Automation Tests

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install

1. Open Cypress (GUI mode)
npx cypress open
2. Run all tests in headless mode
npx cypress run
--------------------------------------------------

🎯 Project Purpose & Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Plan and document a full testing cycle

- Design detailed manual test cases

- Identify and report defects professionally

- Build and structure UI automation using Cypress

- Maintain test traceability through RTM

- Work with demo systems as if they were production environments

This repository is part of my QA portfolio and showcases both manual and automation testing capabilities.
